 *
 * Usage:
 * ufieldpositer_open creates an empty (unset) UFieldPositionIterator.
 * This can be passed to format functions such as {@link #udat_formatForFields},
 * which will set it to apply to the fields in a particular formatted string.
 * ufieldpositer_next can then be used to iterate over those fields,
 * providing for each field its type (using values that are specific to the
 * particular format type, such as date or number formats), as well as the
 * start and end positions of the field in the formatted string.
 * A given UFieldPositionIterator can be re-used for different format calls;
 * each such call resets it to apply to that format string.
 * ufieldpositer_close should be called to dispose of the UFieldPositionIterator
 * when it is no longer needed.
